# rax_web_app cookbook
This is a simple wrapper cookbook to deploy a LAMP stack on a single machine
register it with DNS and monitoring. This is a demo of chef's capabilities, because
we're using chef-solo and Vagrant we're not able to show case multiple orchestrations
but this is a good start. To use this demo you just need to populate your attributes/default.rb
which has your Rackspace credentials and node domain.
